"# RadioCNN" 

Using a CNN to conduct signal equalization & demodulation over a frequency-selective channel.

Step 1: Use "./Data Generation/GenData.m" to generate raw data, which is obtained from passing QPSK signals through a frequency-selective channel with 16 scattering paths.

Step 2: Run "./radioCNN.py" to train & evaluate on the test data set.
